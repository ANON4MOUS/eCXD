# Vulnero - A .ELF Vulnerable Application
Vulnero is another C vulnerable code I developed while trying to combine multiple advanced binary exploitation techniques in one single exploit. Exploiting this code may go beyond a simple stack smashing, and chaining multiple memory leaks and memory overwritings may be required to complete this challenge. It is clear that difficulty increases based upon how you compile the code. 

NB: To make exploit development activities a bit trickier you could also try removing the "to_remove" function other than just compiling the code with all memory protections and making sure ASLR is enabled on the machine.
