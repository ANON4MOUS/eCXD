## Shellcoding Arsenal
This is the shellcode 'arsenal' I developed before taking the exam. The reason I did this is because I prefer not using msfvenom-generated payloads because they are too large. Often times I've ended up dealing with limited buffer space. However I always opt for short, custom shellcodes first instead of just deploying egghunters. What is more, I have been coming across situations where egghunters are literally useless. This often happens with applications having just a few functionalities not allowing users to send multiple inputs at the same time.
### Limitations
Remember everything comes for a price. Some of these shellcodes have downsides. In particular, developing a short Windows shellcode like the ones in here significantly increases compatibility issues. This happens because some addresses have to be hardcoded to make the shellcode this short. Hardcoded address will not work if ASLR is enabled though as they would change at every single system reboot. In addition, using the same addresses on different versions of the same OS may not work out either, even if ASLR is not enabled. For example a shellcode working on Windows XP Service Pack 3 may not work on SP2.
