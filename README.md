# eCXD - eLearnSecurity Certified eXploit Developer ðŸŒ‹

## Repository Content
I created this repository while studying towards the eCXD exam. Here you can find both Windows and Linux exploit development material. A significant portion of the repository is dedicated to exploit code, but there's also some vulnerable C code that I developed for Linux platforms just to make experiments with the skills gained during the Exploit Development Student course. Each folder comes with instructions explaining the content of the specific section you are in. So feel free to explore and good luck with your exam!

*Enjoy!*
