# bineX-Arena
**Hijacking execution flows since the early days - Learn, Train, Grow**

---------------------------------------------------------------

## What is it?
I created this repository while studying towards the eCXD exam. Right now this is just a disorganized collection of different types of exploits and binary exploitation challenges for both Windows and Linux operating systems. The idea is to create an 'Arena' where any beginner/intermediate user can learn new things and train its binary exploitation and exploit development skills. Clearly this project is still incomplete, but you can expect regular updates.

*Enjoy!*
