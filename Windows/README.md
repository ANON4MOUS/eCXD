## Windows Exploitation
This section contains some CVE proof-of-concepts, as well as multiple Vulnserver exploits. In general, you can find basic stack-based buffer overflows, SEH overflows, and ASLR + DEP bypass exploits. Some exploitation scenarios also come with very specific limitations and challenges, such as very short buffer spaces where the deployment of an egghunter may sound as the only viable option, or the need to perform an accurate stack-pivoting from the SE handler to land on a ROP chain. This section may turn useful when trying to get a picture of what Windows user-mode exploitation looks like, including the methodology needed to bypass common memory protections and limitations.
